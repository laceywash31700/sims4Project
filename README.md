# sims4Project
the intention for this mod is to force start build and buy cheats

I have added a hellow function for testing to see if I connected to the cheat console 

so far only that is functional with the mode the file name for my creator name is din0saursN5pace that should be in front of all my scripts except the mts clown one I was looking at that code for reference.

## to run 
 * first you need to have the sims 4 downloaded in you computer 

 * then you need to run the compile.py script to compile the code into a .ts4script 

 * then in you mods folder the path should be (documents/ea games/the sims 4/ mods) if you downloaded it from ea, place the script in the folder
__________
***Warning***
* you should not have any sub folders for the game does not dig into the mods folder subfolder for scripts so they should be surface level
